# hack4lx-BIN-list
This repository is an open-source list of Issuer Identification Numbers (IIN), which are more commonly known as a Bank Identification Number (BIN).



Using the list
**********************************************************
You are free to use this list for any purpose, including private or commercial use.

This data is not an official IIN register. I scraped and compiled this data to help with learning Python, and although it is a fairly comprehensive and accurate BIN list, it's not perfect. Use at your own risk!

If you do use this list in your own projects, please link to the site if you can. I'd like to get some contributions to improve the list over time and the more people who see the site, the more contributors we might get.
